          By using elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and

        <h3>Ease of Maintenance</h3>
        <p>
          Using semantic elements makes it easier for developers to read and
          maintain code, as the structure of the document is clearer and more
          intuitive.

        <h3>Did You Know?</h3>
        <p>
          The &lt;article&gt; element can be used independently of the rest of
          the web page content, making it ideal for blog posts, news articles,
          and more.
